# Coursera ML in Python
This repo is intended to convert all the homework codes of the machine learning class on Coursera from Octave/Matlab to Python.

Currently, I'm intend to update one homework assignment per week.

## Changelog
* 3/24/2019 Initial repo
* 3/25/2019 Linear Regression code uploaded. For some unknown reason, the contour graph I plotted is not showing the thetas are local optimal, but the actual values do meet the expectation.
